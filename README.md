## Overview
Most of the functions are bound to the H Scene and integrated in [KK(S)_VR](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KKS_VR) version 2.0+.
Those functions are:
* Alternative dynamic neck and eye movements
* Full auto mode for *Service/Course* actions, semi-auto (requires user start) for *Caress* actions
* Actually working mainGame port of CyuVR, mostly exclusive to the VR

#### Also features:
* Variety of patches to tweak game's shortcomings.


By default the plugin works only in VR mode, can be changed in the settings.  
Nearly whole functional works outside of VR.  

Everything can be disabled at any given moment through settings. Changes take place after the scene change.

### AutoMode
Caress auto starts/stops after prolonged *MouseClick* or *Trigger* on an attached aitem, the rest is config driven.

### Alternative eye/neck control
Present in viable positions only, can glitch a bit when providing some functional to KK(S)_VR in non-viable positions.
